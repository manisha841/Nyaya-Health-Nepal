# Solution2 Function

The `solution2()` function is designed to find pairs of numbers in a given list that sum up to a specific value. It iterates through the list and checks each pair of numbers. If a pair is found with a sum equal to the specified `pair_sum`, it prints the pair. If no pairs are found, it displays a message indicating that no pairs were found.

## Usage

To use the `solution2()` function, follow these steps:

1. Call the function: `solution2(input_list, pair_sum)`.
2. Pass the list of numbers as the `input_list` argument.
3. Provide the target sum as the `pair_sum` argument.
4. The function will iterate through the list and print the pairs of numbers that sum up to the `pair_sum` value.
